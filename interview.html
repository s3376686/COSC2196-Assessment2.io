        <h2>IT Interview</h2>

        <p>Raymond, a senior software developer of 11+ years' experience, an ANU graduate in computer science currently
            working for IBM. Interview held on Friday 7 July by David Martin.</p>



        <q>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</q>

        <p>I am a senior software developer and I specialise in Java software development and integration. My work will
            vary depending on the needs of the project but some examples of what I do exactly include working on
            development of web-based applications, enterprise integrations and systems that use Java frameworks. I am
            involved in all stages of the development life cycle of software development and sometimes I will act as a
            technical or team lead which involves more focus on communicating with other team leads and clients.
            Typically, my experience is used within a team to help drive implementation and to help others with some of
            the intricate issues that can arise throughout the development process.</p>

        <q>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</q>

        <p>I am employed with IBM who provide a host of IT solutions and products for their clients. As an example, the
            current project I am working on is for the department of defence which is to integrate improvements and
            efficiencies to existing frameworks. With regards to the industry, IT companies like IBM will have a client
            base of businesses which they consult with to provide a digital strategy. Some examples of client
            requirements can involve data migration, maintenance and upgrades, cyber security, and automation.</p>

        <q>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</q>

        <p>A senior developer has additional management responsibilities which involves a lot of collaboration with the
            client and other teams to advise on progress and track performance. The expectation is to have in depth
            knowledge of the project to assist in tasks and implementation but to also, when required, be involved with
            the business elements of project management. There is also the expectation to follow best practices with
            design architecture to deliver quality design – for example, I may need to review other developers’ work to
            make sure they are following good coding practice, so we are providing best value. When meeting with other
            teams it is important to understand agile principles and frameworks, such as scrum.</p>

        <q>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about
            them.</q>

        <p>Within a team I would be working closely with other software developers of various degrees of experience and
            a team lead – potentially at times I could be taking on that role depending on circumstances. Outside of the
            team I interact with other team leads and senior developers and some external clients and contractors.
            External clients are usually involved in the development cycle to track progress, feasibility, and budget.
            Contractors can be external hires such as testers or auditors which have been outsourced to meet
            requirements such as quality assurance or user testing. Outside of a project, I would interact with company
            bosses such as partners and senior managers who would oversee projects and allocate resources.</p>

        <q>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</q>

        <p>I believe in the importance of mentorship and try to utilise my skills to assist with junior developers and
            their tasks while also interacting with senior managers and developers to continually improve on my skill
            sets. It is also important to interact with seniority to further understand the business goals and vision.
            Those sorts of discussions are face to face and informal, with more formal stand-up meetings or call ins for
            formal work. I also interact with a recruiter who assisted me in getting the role I am in currently and
            previous contractor roles as a developer. I use LinkedIn to network with other IT professionals or stay
            connected with people who I have worked with in the past of studied with when I was at university.</p>

        <q>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</q>

        <p>One essential element of the job is being able to have a meeting with various clients and understand that
            they will have different motivations and expectations. An auditor will be focused on time and spending and
            so a meeting with them will be different to a meeting of developers who are focused on the immediate task of
            coding and frameworks. Interactions with these clients are formal and involve meetings answering questions
            about the development life cycle with respect to time, goals, and budget.</p>

        <q>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</q>

        <p>This would depend on the area of the lifecycle and how well a project is going against expectation but
            usually it is the development phase which is where the rubber meets the road and engineering code for both
            front end and back end is undertaken. Initial analysis and design phases can take some time to plan and map
            out and there has certainly been instances where the testing phase has entered scope creep, leading to
            additional time being spent trying to solve intricate problems. From an operational perspective most of my
            time on a day-to-day basis is spent in meetings or catch ups these days and I am rarely coding.</p>

        <q>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</q>

        <p>Problem solving in general is challenging, particularly when there’s deadlines to consider and the problem
            is quite unique and tough to crack. Otherwise, collaborating with stakeholders and other teams can be
            challenging because it really highlights a range of capabilities and how many moving parts can be involved
            in any one project. Frustration can set in if another team is responsible for everyone falling behind so it
            is a challenge to keep the team motivated at times as that requires some performance management which can be
            behavioural and that is where a senior software developer takes on a more hybrid leadership role.</p>

        <q>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
            the IT industry?</q>

        <p>The example I use would apply to any IT project from any company and it is working within a team of diverse
            people with various skillsets and levels of experience coming together to complete a goal. It is crucial to
            understand the importance of teamwork and setting out clear and achievable goals – often with an agile
            methodology – and constant communication. I think about all the phases of software development and all the
            external and internal actors and regardless of stage or environment, it will be team performance that
            decides quality and efficiencies in all processes and architecture.</p>
